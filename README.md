# CureQ-Lab
This repository contains libraries for the CureQ consortium and research projects of the CureQ Lab, which are developed as part of the Applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) master thesis and the Biomedical Engineering (BMT) bachelor thesis at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (HvA).

## CureQ projects

We have made 2 GUI's for projects regarding the CureQ consortium. 
- The first GUI (MEAlytics) performs analysis of the Micro-electrode Array (MEA) experiments.
- The second GUI performs analysis of microscopy images.

### MEAlytics

[MEAlytics](https://github.com/CureQ/CureQ) is a python package for analyzing Micro-electrode Array (MEA) experiments. This package offers high speed spike, burst and network burst detection followed by feature extraction. <br>The whole analysis tool is implemented in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI is used to inspect the raw MEA data and the analysis results. 

The MEAlytics tool also has a few other brances, which has not yet been merged with the main branch. These projects are about a newly introduced Synchronisation method and a Spike heatmap & Machine Learning predictions.

### Microscopy 

The [Microscopy GUI](https://github.com/CureQ/Microscopy) performs segmentation and statistical calculations on microscopy images. <br>The current main version provides the cell body detection application to analyze microscopy images and identify cell bodies in the provided samples.

The Microscopy tool also has a few other brances, which has not yet been merged with the main branch. These projects are about Aggregate quantification and Colocalization.
